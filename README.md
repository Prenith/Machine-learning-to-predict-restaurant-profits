# Machine-learning-to-predict-hotel-profits

This study aims to identify and implement a suitable machine learning technique appropriate for
a problem regarding the prediction of a new hotel of a large hotel chain if opened in a given location to be
profitable or not.

 Location is one of the most important factors affecting the business of a hotel. The location of the
hotel determines whether the business of the hotel would seek profit of not. The location along with the
geographical data and socio-economic data such as health, crime, population, availability to public
transport etc. would be some of the most important factors required for us to proceed with the machine
learning process. Luckily, we are provided with the historical data of successful and unsuccessful hotels
opened under the chain’s brand on similar locational conditions and also provided with the geographical
and socio-economic data about the locations and neighborhoods.
 To proceed with the prediction, we must perform predictive task on the given set of data. There are
various predictive tasks available for designing a machine learning system. Some of them are,
• Classification
• Regression
• Clustering
• Rules mining etc.

 We will be proceeding with the Classification type of prediction technique because classification
predicts the belonging to a class. Classification technique is preferred when the results of the model need
to return the belongingness of data points in a dataset to specific classes. In our case, we want to find out
whether the hotel would turn out to be as either class, profit which is true or class loss which is false
based on the given set of data.
